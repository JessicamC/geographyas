This website is run by me, Alex. I'm a student studying Geography and I'm also a tech head. I make [apps](https://github.com/alexjohnj), [websites](http://alexj.me) (duh) and [tutorials](http://simplecode.me). I'm also a geography enthusiast (more specifically a geophysics enthusiast (more specifically an astrogeophysics enthusiast)). 

I made this website in my free time, originally as a way to backup my geography notes. When a couple of friends said that it was quite a handy website I started to put some more time and effort into developing the website and began to use the site to exercise my web development and design skills.

I need to point out that while I write all the content on this website and maintain it, it's my two (awesome) geography teachers who actually supply the original information (obviously) so I just want to say thanks to them! 

## Want To Help Out?

Good news, this website is open source (so anyone can make contributions to it)! If you're a developer you can help improve the website by filing issues and making pull requests on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexjohnj/geographyas). 

I'm going to guess that the majority of people using this site aren't developers though. If you want to contribute some information, or if you find a mistake, *please* get in touch and let me know. You can contact me via <mailto:alex@geographyas.info>. Any contributions are greatly appreciated and you will be credited for your help.
