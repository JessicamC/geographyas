Waves are a medium through which energy is transferred. They are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the sea. Frictional drag increases as the wind speed increases, making the wave bigger. 

Wave energy depends upon three things:

1. The strength of the wind.
2. The length of time the wind has blown for. 
3. The fetch of the wind (the distance it blows over).

| Swash | Body of foaming water rushing up the beach.
| Inshore | The area between the low water mark and the point where waves cease to have any influence on the land beneath them.
| Wave length (L/ƛ) | The distance between two crests (L = C × T)
| Wave steepness (H ÷ L) | The ratio of wave height to wave length. It cannot exceed 1:7 as at this point the wave will break.
| Wave velocity | The speed of movement of a crest in a given period of time. 
| Foreshore | The area lying between the high water mark and the low water mark. It is seen as the most important zone for marine processes. 
| Wave period (T) | The time taken for a wave to travel through one wavelength.
| Offshore | The area beyond the point where the waves cease to impact upon the seabed, and in which activity is limited to the deposition of sediments.
| Trough | The lowest point of a wave.
| Backshore | The area between the high water mark and the landward limit of marine activity. 
| Energy (E) | E is proportional to (L × H)<sup>2</sup>
| Wave Height (H) | The distance between the crest and the trough. When this exceeds 6m it is a real hazard. 
| Crest | Highest point of a wave.
| Swell | Characterised by waves of low height, gentle steepness, long wavelength and a long period. 
| Plunge line | Where the depth of water and the height of the wave are virtually equal. 
| Backwash | Water returning to the sea.
