A coast is a narrow zone where the land and sea overlap and directly interact. 

## Factors Effecting Coasts

### Terrestrial 

- Rock type on the coast. If it's soft rock it will be eroded far more easily than if it's hard rock. 
- Deltas form where rivers meat the sea, which will alter the shape of coasts. 
- Composition of rock layers on coasts will affect the shape of coasts.
- Tectonics in the area will effect coasts. Earthquakes can move rock and trigger tsunamis, which can destroy entire coasts.
- Mangroves and coral reefs can alter the shape of the shape of coasts as they slow down incoming waves, slowing erosion of coasts. 

### Human

- Ports, docks and transport can be constructed and used on coasts, thus altering the shape of coasts. Boats can destroy coral reefs and hence increase the erosion of the coasts. 
- Coasts can be used for recreation and tourism. The increased foot traffic and demand for certain attractions on coasts can alter their shape substantially. 
- Humans can settle on coasts. Often, settlements on coasts will thrive due to their proximity to the sea for trade. 
- Global warming is altering the shape of coasts due to the rising sea levels resulting from it. 

### Atmospheric

- Certain types of weather can effect coasts. High winds and heavy rain will erode coasts. 
- The Moon (and the Sun and Jupiter to some extent) effects the tides substantially, which can alter the shape of coasts.
- Temperatures alter the shape of coasts. 

### Marine

- Biotic creatures such as Coral alter the shapes of coasts for the aforementioned reasons.
- Waves, tides & salt spray all play their part in altering the shape of coasts. 

## Open Systems

Coasts are examples of open systems. They have inputs and outputs.

### Inputs

- Energy is inputted in the form of waves, wind currents and tides. These will vary spatially and temporally (space and time, no not [*that* space and time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_and_time)).
- Sediment from other eroded coastlines, rivers and off-shore sub-aerial processes will be deposited along coasts. 
- Human activity will provide inputs for coastal systems. 

### Processes

- Erosion, transportation and deposition all take place on coasts along with longshore drift, biological activity and wind transport (known as aeolian). 

### Outputs

- Landforms, sediment and the shape and position of the coastline are all examples of outputs.
