Population can be measure according to:

- Age
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Language
- Religion
- Occupation

### Representing Population Structure

- The age and sex structure of a population can be shown using a population pyramid. 
- The age composition of different countries can be represented on a population triangle. 

### Population Pyramids

#### Stage 1

High birth rate, rapid fall in each upward age group due to high death rate resulting in a low life expectancy. 

#### Stage 2

High birth rate, declining death rate, slightly longer life expectancy.

#### Stage 3

Declining birth rate, low death rate, more old people.

#### Stage 4

Low birth rate, low death rate, rising dependancy ratio. Long life expectancy. 

### The Dependency Ratio

The dependency ratio is the relationship between the working (economically active) population and the non-economically active population (dependant). It's calculated using:

> Dependency Ratio = Population (0 - 14) + Population (65+) / Population (15-64)

### The Support Ratio

The support ratio is the inverse of the dependency ratio:

> Support Ratio = Population (15 - 64) / Population (65+)

### Juvenile Index

The juvenile index indicates the proportion of young people to old people. The greater the index, the more young people there are. 

> Juvenile Index = Population (0 - 14) / Population (15+)

### Old Age Index

The old age index indicates the proportion of old people to young people. The higher the old age ratio the greater the number of old people.

> Old Age Index = Population (65+) / Population (15-64)
