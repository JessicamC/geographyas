### World Population Facts

- The current world population is approximately <del>6.9</del> 7 billion people.
- World population should reach 10 billion by 2080 and then stabilise.
- Population growth is much higher in LEDCs than MEDCs.  

### The World Population

Between 1750 and 1930, the world's population increased steadily going from 0.79 billion to 2.07 billion over 180 years. Between 1750 and 1930 the annual population increase rose steadily going from an increase of 0.19 billion (1750 - 1800) to an increase of 0.39 billion between 1850 and 1900. After the year 1930, the world's population began to grow exponentially increasing by 3.54 billion between 1950 and 2000. The increase in population every decade also rose between 1950 to 2000. Going from a 0.22 billion increase (1940 - 1950) to a 0.79 billion increase (1990 - 2000). Between 2000 and 2030 the population begins to show signs of levelling off as the population is predicted to increase by only 0.61 billion between 2020 and 2030.

### Population Doubling Time

- 2% growth rate - population doubling time would be about 35 years.
- 3% growth rate - population doubling time would be about 24 years. 
- 4% growth rate - population doubling time would be about 17 years.

### Components of  Population Change

- Fertility (births)
- Mortality (deaths)
- Migration (movement)

> Population Change = Birth Rate ± Death Rate ± Migration

### Natural Change

The change in the size of a population caused by the interrelationship between birth and death rates. If the birth rate exceeds the death rate then the population will increase. If the death rate exceeds the birth rate then the population will decrease.

### Annual Population Change 

The cumulative change to the size of a population after both natural change and migration have been accounted for.
