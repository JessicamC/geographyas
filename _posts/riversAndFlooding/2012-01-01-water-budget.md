The Water Budget

Evapotranspiration is low during the winter months as a limited amount of daylight is received during winter and so not much water can be evaporated. In addition, temperatures are lower during winter, again limiting the amount of water that can be evaporated. In summer, the hours of daylight increase, causing an increase in the amount of water evaporated. In addition, temperatures are higher again increasing the quantity of water that can be evaporated. Finally, during summer, the vast majority of trees will have leaves which will increase the surface area of the trees and therefore the amount of water lost. 

The evapotranspiration levels are referred to as potential as it is impossible to gauge exactly how much water is actually being evaporated from trees and other organisms. 

The precipitation levels are high during the winter as there is a lot of rainfall and snowfall during the winter. During the summer, precipitation levels fall since there is less rain fall during the summer.
