## Braided Channels

Braided channels occur in rivers with lots of load, a steep gradient and where the course and discharge of the river fluctuate daily or annually. Rivers with a large volume of load and high discharge experience flash floods in arid areas or are swollen with water in cold climates. In these types of areas there is little vegetation so erosion of the load is rapid. In these rivers deposition occurs in the form of sand and gravel islands that divide the channel into smaller channels as the river navigates its large bed load. 

## Levees

Levees are quite simple depositional landforms. They're the result of river flooding and, ironically, make it more difficult for a river to flood in the future. When a river floods, friction with the area it floods onto results in a rapid decrease in the river's competence. This forces the river to deposit its load and the largest, coarsest load is deposited very quickly. The load is often deposited on the very edge of the river bank forming raised mounds. As the finer material is deposited, the raised mounds appear to taper off. These raised mounds are what are known as *levees*. Levees aren't permanent structures, if the river's volume becomes too great they can be destroyed by the pressure of the water against them but they provide an additional mechanism for preventing the river from flooding. The levees increase the height of the river's channel and so the peak discharge needed for the river to overflow its new banks and flood becomes greater. 

## Floodplains

Floodplains are flat sections of land that form on either side of a river and are technically features of both deposition and erosion (though mostly deposition). Floodplains are made up of alluvium, the deposited sediment from when a river floods. As the alluvium is very fertile, farmlands are often constructed on the river floodplain. 

The width of a floodplain is determined by the sinuosity of the river and the amount of meander migration that takes place in the river. As meanders migrate, the areas onto which they flood changes and so the floodplain can become wider. The dept of the floodplain, or specifically the depth of the alluvium is determined by both the frequency of the floods and the amount of sediment in the river. As flooding is mainly a feature of rivers in the lower course, rivers generally have a lot of sediment in them at this stage and so the alluvium can be quite deep. However, the river must also frequently flood, otherwise the alluvium will not be able to build up to a particularly deep depth.
