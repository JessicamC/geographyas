## Braided Channels

Braided channels occur in rivers with lots of load, a steep gradient and where the course and discharge of the river fluctuate daily or annually. Rivers with a large volume of load and high discharge experience flash floods in arid areas or are swollen with water in cold climates. In these types of areas there is little vegetation so erosion of the load is rapid. In these rivers deposition occurs in the form of sand and gravel islands that divide the channel into smaller channels as the river navigates its large bed load. 

## Levees

Levees are quite simple depositional landforms. They're the result of river flooding and, ironically, make it more difficult for a river to flood in the future. When a river floods, friction with the area it floods onto results in a rapid decrease in the river's competence. This forces the river to deposit its load and the largest, coarsest load is deposited very quickly. The load is often deposited on the very edge of the river bank forming raised mounds. As the finer material is deposited, the raised mounds appear to taper off. These raised mounds are what are known as *levees*. Levees aren't permanent structures, if the river's volume becomes too great they can be destroyed by the pressure of the water against them but they provide an additional mechanism for preventing the river from flooding. The levees increase the height of the river's channel and so the peak discharge needed for the river to overflow its new banks and flood becomes greater. 

## Floodplains

Floodplains are flat sections of land that form on either side of a river and are technically features of both deposition and erosion (though mostly deposition). Floodplains are made up of alluvium, the deposited sediment from when a river floods. As the alluvium is very fertile, farmlands are often constructed on the river floodplain. 

The width of a floodplain is determined by the sinuosity of the river and the amount of meander migration that takes place in the river. As meanders migrate, the areas onto which they flood changes and so the floodplain can become wider. The dept of the floodplain, or specifically the depth of the alluvium is determined by both the frequency of the floods and the amount of sediment in the river. As flooding is mainly a feature of rivers in the lower course, rivers generally have a lot of sediment in them at this stage and so the alluvium can be quite deep. However, the river must also frequently flood, otherwise the alluvium will not be able to build up to a particularly deep depth. 

## Oxbow Lakes

Oxbow lakes are the result of an increasing sinuosity of a river. They are a feature of both deposition and erosion. As a river's sinuosity increases erosion on the outside bend of the meander increases whilst deposition on the inside bend increases too. As a result, the neck of the meander becomes narrower and, during periods of flood, the river cuts across the neck. Eventually, the neck is blocked off with deposition and the river assumes a new, straight, course across the neck. The old course becomes an oxbow lake. Over time, the lake dries up leaving a meander scar.

## Deltas

Deltas are depositional land forms. Deltas are found at a river's mouth, by the sea, or as a river joins a lake or reservoir where there is a low tidal range (The height difference between the high and low tides. A low range means that deposition can occur without being washed away). They spread out to sea as what are known as “Deltaic Deposits”. They are flat areas of land and consist of many distributaries (The opposite to a tributary, it flows away form the river) and levees. Levees often join together in deltas due to spits and bars which form lagoons (bayous). 

### Delta Beds

Deltas are made up of three different types of beds. The bottom bed, the _bottom-set_ bed, is mainly composed of clay. When clay comes into contact with salt water a process called flocculation occurs were an electric charge develops and the clay and salt particles clump together. As a result of the increased mass, the particles sink forming the bottom-set bed. The next bed is the _fore-set_ bed, composed primarily of silt and slightly coarse particles. This deposition occurs simply due to a loss of energy as the river's gradient flattens. The topmost bed is the _top-set_ bed. This is composed of coarse material, mostly sand and is again the result of the river loosing energy and so depositing its load. 

### Shapes of Deltas

Deltas can be classified as one of three different shapes:

#### [Cuspate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS61C-42-72.jpg)

##### e.g. Niger River

Cuspate deltas are triangular in shape (which is where the term delta comes from, the greek letter delta Δ). They form when a river meets a sea with alternating current directions. These alternating current directions shape the delta so that it looks similar to a triangle. 

#### [Bird's Foot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mississippi_delta_from_space.jpg) 

##### e.g. Mississippi River Delta

Bird's foot deltas are named as so due to their shape that somewhat resembles a bird's foot. The only one in existence is the Mississippi River Delta. Bird's foot deltas have many distributaries and, as a result of deposition, they have many lagoons.

#### [Arcuate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NileDelta-EO.JPG)

##### e.g. Nile River

Arcuate deltas are round and look similar to a bow. They have dendritic patterns of distributaries and sediment deposited at the delta is moved around by long shore drift.
