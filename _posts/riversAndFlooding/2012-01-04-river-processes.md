_Erosion_ - The break up and removal of rocks by the action of rock particles being moved over the surface by water, wind or ice.

_The Weight Of The Water_ - The greater the mass of the water the more energy it will possess due to the influence of gravity on its movement. 

_The height of the river above sea level_ - This gives the river a source of potential energy. The higher the source of the river the more energy it has. 

_The steepness of the channel_ - This controls the speed of the river which determines how much kinetic energy it has.

### Erosion Processes

- _Corrasion_ - Load is dragged along the bed of the river eroding it like sand paper. 
- _Corrosion_ - The acidic nature of the water erodes susceptible rocks (e.g Limestone)
- _Attrition_ - Load collides together breaking of chunks of load and therefore eroding it.
- _Hydraulic Action_ - The movement of water and air into cracks breaking apart rocks. Highly effective in high velocity rivers.

### Deposition

- Deposition occurs in areas with low velocity such as:
	- The mouth of the river.
	- An area with a relatively low gradient.
	- An area that experiences droughts.
	- An river flooding reduces velocity due to an increase friction.
	- The inside of a meander where friction increases due to a decrease in the volume of the water.
 	- An increase in the load of the river causing the river to exceed its capacity.
	- A river crossing an area of permeable rock, which increases percolation rates, leading to a decreased volume of water in the channel.

### Load Transport Processes

- _Saltation_ - Load is bounced along the bed of the river.
- _Solution_ - Load is disolved into the river water. 
- _Suspension_ - Load is suspended in the river water.
- _Traction_ - Load is rolled along the river bed. 

### Key Terms 

- _Capacity_ - The total volume of load that can be carried in the channel at a specific location at a specific time.
- _Competence_ - The largest transported particle that can be transported at a particular stream velocity.
