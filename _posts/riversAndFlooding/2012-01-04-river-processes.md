## Factors Effecting a River's Energy

_The Weight Of The Water_ - The greater the mass of the water the more energy it will possess due to the influence of gravity on its movement. 

_The height of the river above sea level_ - This gives the river a source of potential energy. The higher the source of the river the more energy it has. 

_The steepness of the channel_ - This controls the speed of the river which determines how much kinetic energy it has.

## Erosion

- _Erosion_ - Erosion is the breakup and removal of rocks overtime by other rocks or the water. The key feature of erosion that makes it different from weathering is that it involves the removal of the broken up rocks. 

## Processes
- _Corrasion_ - Also known as abrasion, this is where the river channel is eroded by the river's load. The load is dragged along the bed of the river and deepens it by wearing it away like sand paper. Corrasion can erode laterally but it isn't as effective as the vertical erosion provided by corrasion. Corrasion is most effective during turbulent flow after heavy rainfall.  
- _Corrosion_ - This is where the acidic nature of the river water dissolves rocks that are susceptible to corrosion such as limestone. This can erode both load and the river channel and is particularly effective against susceptible rocks. 
- _Attrition_ - This is where load is knocked about during transportation and different pieces of load collide with each other, eroding each other and rounding them. 
- _Hydraulic Action_ - This is simply the force of the water acting on rocks and breaking pieces of rock away. Hydraulic action can also be the forcing of air into cracks in the river channel which is held in the cracks under immense pressure. When the air is able to escape, it does so in a (minor) explosive decompression, damaging the rock. Hydraulic action is most effective at removing already loose material and is often responsible for undercutting of river banks. Hydraulic action is strongest when the river has a high velocity. 

## Deposition

- Deposition occurs in areas where the river has a low velocity and low energy such as:
	- The mouth of the river.
	- An area with a relatively low gradient.
	- An area that experiences droughts.
	- An river flooding reduces velocity due to an increase friction.
	- The inside of a meander where friction increases due to a decrease in the volume of the water.
 	- An increase in the load of the river causing the river to exceed its capacity.
	- A river crossing an area of permeable rock, which increases percolation rates, leading to a decreased volume of water in the channel.

## Load Transportation

- _Saltation_ - This is where medium sized load is bounced along the bed of the river. As it does so, it can dislodge rocks on the bed of the river and they too can start being transported via saltation. 
- _Solution_ - Minerals and rocks susceptible to corrosion are dissolved into the river water and are transported within the water. 
- _Suspension_ - Very fine particles such as clay and silt simply “float” within the water touching the bed. This is only really possible in faster flowing rivers that have enough energy to keep the particles in suspension. 
- _Traction_ - This is how the river transports its largest load. The load is simply rolled along the bed of the river. It is only possible for this sort of transportation to take place in rivers with a lot of energy, normally after a period of high discharge.  

When describing the ability of the river to transport and erode load, two terms are commonly thrown about. These terms are the *capacity* and the *competence* of the river. The *capacity* of the river is the volume of load that a river can transport. The *competence* of the river is the size of the largest piece of load that the river can transport. The capacity and competence of a river are tied directly to the velocity of a river, with the capacity and competence of the river increasing as the velocity of the river increases too. 

## The Hjulström Curve

### Reading the Hjulström Curve

Reading the Hjulström curve is relatively simple. Along the x axis is a range of particle sizes from small to large and along the y axis is the mean velocity of the river. There's then two curves on the graph; the erosion velocity curve and the settling velocity curve. Considering the erosion velocity curve, if you read up from a specific particle size then you can approximate the velocity the river must flow at in order to erode this sized particle (ignoring erosion via corrosion). One thing of interest is that the smaller particles require just as high a velocity to erode and transport as the larger particles. This is due to the cohesive nature of smaller particles such as clay and silt which causes them to stick together. These particles can settle on the bed of a river and never be transported due to this property. Equally interesting though is the settling velocity for these incredibly small particles. Even if the river's velocity is nearly 0cms<sup>-2</sup>, these particles will continue to remain in solution (assuming they've been picked up) and may never be deposited on the river bed. 

### Problems associated with the Hjulström Curve

There are a few issues with the Hjulström curve. For starters, it only considers the mean velocity of a river and so is only an estimate of the velocities needed to transport, erode and deposit material in different sections of the river. It can only be used to consider the river as a whole and using it to estimate the velocities needed to move particles in specific sections of the river is highly inaccurate. 

Another issue with the Hjulström curve is that it assumes that the river is perfectly formed in that there are no bumps in the river's channel. This is partly due to just considering the mean velocity but it has the same consequential effects on the usefulness of the Hjulström curve in the sense that the Hjulström curve can only be used to make approximations, and very rough ones at that.
