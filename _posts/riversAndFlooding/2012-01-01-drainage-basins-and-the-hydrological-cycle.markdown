Rivers are dynamic, open systems. They take water from the global hydrological cycle and also put water back into the global hydrological cycle. The global hydrological cycle is a closed system. It (as far as you're aware) doesn't have any inputs or outputs, it remains constant[^1].

When considering the hydrological cycle of a river, normally you look at the river's _drainage basin_. The drainage basin of a river is defined as the area surrounding a river where rain water flows into the river. It can also be called the catchment area since it's where the river “catches” its water. The boundary between two drainage basins is known as the _watershed_. Beyond the watershed, any rain that falls lands in a different drainage basin and flows into a different river.

## Inputs & Outputs

A drainage basin is an open system, so it has inputs and outputs. The most obvious input is rain (at least here in Britain) but snow, hail & dew all act as inputs too. These inputs (including rain) can be grouped under one term _precipitation_, water that falls or condenses on the ground. Basins also have outputs that are, again, pretty obvious. Evaporation is a big one, where water is turned into a gas and lost to the atmosphere. Transpiration is similar to evaporation but is the loss of water as a vapour from plant and tree leaves. The combined effect of evaporation and transpiration is known as _evapotranspiration_.  The output that a lot of people forget is water simply flowing out of the basin. The technical name for this is _river discharge_.

## Stores

Stores are ways that water is stored in the drainage basin’s hydrological cycle. There’s a couple of different types of water storage. One is _vegetation storage_. Vegetation lives off of water right? Well, any vegetation in a drainage basin will take up precipitation and store it, simple. The vegetation storage is the total volume of water stored in vegetation at one time. 

Vegetation also provides another type of storage, _intercepted storage_. Not all water is absorbed by vegetation, some of it is caught (intercepted) by it and just sits on the leaves. This water is still being stored in the drainage basin so the interception of water is another type of store. While interception by vegetation is the most common type of storage, buildings and other structures can also intercept water and any water intercepted by them will be part of the basin’s store. 

A lake or a pond is a type of storage as is their smaller cousin, a puddle. Yes puddles are small but they all add up to form _surface storage_. This can be quite a significant percentage of the total amount of water stored in a drainage basin. In addition to being stored on the surface, water can be stored inside the ground. This is known as _groundwater storage_. This can be water absorbed by the soil or it could be water that has percolated into rocks. You may have heard of something called the water table. The water table is a form of groundwater storage, it’s made up of lots of aquifers (permeable rocks) that have had their pores filled with water. 

The final sort of storage is so obvious it isn’t obvious. Remember, we’re talking about stores in a drainage basin here, not the river itself, so the river’s channel that flows through the basin is a giant store! Duh.

## Flows

Flows are pretty simple, they’re just the different ways that water can move from point A to B in a drainage basin. One of the obvious types of flow is _channel flow_. The name gives it away, this is where water flows through a river channel. The speed that the water is moved at is highly dependent on the [channel’s efficiency][channel-efficiency]. 

Another type of flow is _overland flow_. You may have heard of this as _surface runoff_. This is where water travels across the surface of the ground when it can’t permeate the ground. You’ll get this sort of flow when the ground has been baked (dried for extensive periods of time) or saturated by previous precipitation and the water can’t infiltrate into the ground. You’ll also get overland flow when you have a lot of impermeable rocks that water can’t travel through. Overland flow is fastest when the water is travelling down a steep sided hill and almost non-existent when the land is very flat. 

I used a term called _infiltration_ in that last paragraph. This is where water seeps into the soil. Once the water’s in the soil, it can travel around in several different ways. One way is through _throughflow_. This is where water moves downhill through the soil under the influence of gravity. The speed of throughflow is dependent on the type of soil and also the presence of things like cracks and burrows which act as tunnels which the water can flow through. Instead of travelling through throughflow, the water can continue to seep into the soil and _percolate_ down to the water table. At this point, it can travel above the water table through permeable rocks as _interflow_. Alternatively, it can get beneath the water table and travel through permeable rocks. This is known as _groundwater flow_. If this groundwater feeds into a river, it’s called _baseflow_. The speed of interflow and groundwater flow is highly dependent on the permeability of the rocks the water’s travelling through. These processes are normally very slow but very permeable rocks will make them faster[^2]. Vesicular[^3] rocks, such as pumice or vesicular basalt, allow water to percolate far more easily than rocks like granite, which aren’t vesicular.

There’s two more type of flow that we haven’t discussed, the first is _stemflow_. Like channel flow, the name’s a bit of a giveaway with this one. Stemflow is water that runs down the stems of plants or, alternatively, the trunks of trees. The second type of flow is _throughfall_ (not to be confused with throughflow). This is where water drips off of leaves that have intercepted precipitation.

## The Water Balance Equation(s)

Eep! Equations. Don’t worry, these equations are easy (they’re just addition), although there is a bit of Greek in them.  The water balance equation(s) relate precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), run off (Q) & soil water storage (S). If you have a value for three of those variables, you can find the other one using simple addition. To find precipitation, for example:

\\[ P = E + Q + \Delta S \\]

<noscript>**Does that equation look garbled to you? You need to enable JavaScript in order to see these equations properly.**</noscript>

That triangle is the Greek letter delta, it means change in, so that equation reads as “precipitation = evapotranspiration + run off + change in soil water storage”. You’ve already met precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil water storage but what’s run off? Run off is the volume of water passing the watershed, that is, flowing out of the drainage basin and into another one. 

Typically, the water balance is used to work out the amount of water stored in the soil rather than the precipitation in the drainage basin since it’s a lot easier to measure all the other variables than it is to measure the volume of water stored in the soil. From this point on, when I talk about water balance, I’m talking about the amount of water stored in the soil with respect to precipitation, evapotranspiration & run off. 

In the UK, or any place with a relatively temperate climate, the water balance changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year as the seasons (and hence the weather) change. In the winter months, there’s a large volume of precipitation but little evapotranspiration. This is primarily due to the colder, wetter climate as well as shorter daylight hours. When there’s more precipitation than there is evapotranspiration it’s called a _ground water surplus_. As the summer months approach, the climate becomes warmer & drier and the daylight hours increase[^4].  This results in less precipitation and more evapotranspiration and we get _ground water utilisation_. All the water that was stored in the soil in the wetter months is starting to be used. By the middle of the summer, so much evapotranspiration has taken place and so little precipitation has taken place that there isn’t much water left stored in the soil, this results in a _ground water deficit_.  As the end of the summer approaches though and the colder, wetter whether starts to appear again, precipitation once again begins to outnumber evapotranspiration and a _ground water recharge_ takes place until we get a ground water surplus again. The cycle just keeps repeating itself over and over again[^5].

You can graph the water balance if you want. If you plot evapotranspiration and precipitation on one axis and the month on another, you’ll get two curves. Here’s an example for a (fictional) drainage basin in the UK or some other temperate climate:

[^1]: Technically this isn't true. The Earth gets water from space when comets impact the Earth and loses water to space too. Water in the upper atmosphere is slowly lost to space as it “evaporates” away. Huge meteorite impacts will throw lots of debris into space which contains a fair bit of water as well. 

[^2]: Yet still not particularly fast. At top speed we’re talking less than 0.5mh<sup>-1</sup>.

[^3]: A vesicular rock is one with a vesicular texture (yay, recursive definitions!), that is, it’s an igneous rock made up of lots of vesicles. Vesicles are cavities within the rock that formed when the lava that made the rock cooled with gas bubbles trapped in it, probably very quickly. As water percolates through the rocks, it can change their texture so that they become amygdaloidal. This is where minerals in the water precipitate (this is different to precipitation) out of the water flowing through the vesicles, over time filling them in. This can create some pretty nice looking rocks like amygdaloidal basalt.

[^4]: OK, maybe the UK was a bad example. 

[^5]: Obviously this doesn’t happen in real life and is nothing more than a rough model. Just look at the UK. We have a ground water surplus all year. OK, we don’t actually, but The Daily Mail would like you to believe we do. They probably say it’s all the immigrant’s fault too. I hate that newspaper. It’s like the Fox News of the UK.
