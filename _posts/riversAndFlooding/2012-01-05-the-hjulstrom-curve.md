1. Large particles need a high velocity to be eroded.
2. Very small clay particles are cohesive and require more energy to erode them.
3. Large particles are deposited first.
4. Very small clay particles and dissolved substances will remain in suspension even if there is next to no flow.

Using the Hjulström Curve
-------------------------

### Problems associated with the Hjulström Curve

- The velocity is the mean flow velocity for the entire river and does not account for variations near the bed and banks where most entrainment takes place. 
- The graph assumes the channel is smooth where as in reality, this is unlikely. 
- Density, shape and material of load is not considered.
