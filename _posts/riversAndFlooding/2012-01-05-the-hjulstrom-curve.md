## Reading the Hjulström Curve

Reading the Hjulström curve is relatively simple. Along the x axis is a range of particle sizes from small to large and along the y axis is the mean velocity of the river. There's then two curves on the graph; the erosion velocity curve and the settling velocity curve. Considering the erosion velocity curve, if you read up from a specific particle size then you can approximate the velocity the river must flow at in order to erode this sized particle (ignoring erosion via corrosion). One thing of interest is that the smaller particles require just as high a velocity to erode and transport as the larger particles. This is due to the cohesive nature of smaller particles such as clay and silt which causes them to stick together. These particles can settle on the bed of a river and never be transported due to this property. Equally interesting though is the settling velocity for these incredibly small particles. Even if the river's velocity is nearly 0cms<sup>-2</sup>, these particles will continue to remain in solution (assuming they've been picked up) and may never be deposited on the river bed. 

## Problems associated with the Hjulström Curve

There are a few issues with the Hjulström curve. For starters, it only considers the mean velocity of a river and so is only an estimate of the velocities needed to transport, erode and deposit material in different sections of the river. It can only be used to consider the river as a whole and using it to estimate the velocities needed to move particles in specific sections of the river is highly inaccurate. 

Another issue with the Hjulström curve is that it assumes that the river is perfectly formed in that there are no bumps in the river's channel. This is partly due to just considering the mean velocity but it has the same consequential effects on the usefulness of the Hjulström curve in the sense that the Hjulström curve can only be used to make approximations, and very rough ones at that.
