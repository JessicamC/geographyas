## Hard Engineering Techniques

- Artificial Levées - built using soil & rubble all down the Mississippi. 
- Wing Dykes - Dykes narrow the channel of the river, increasing its efficiency and hence its velocity. This has the knock on effect of deepening the channel, increasing its capacity. 
- Cut Offs (e.g San Gabriel) 
- Deepening (e.g San Gabriel)
- Revetments (e.g the Mississippi) - Slopes the sides of the river, increasing friction and slowing the river. 
- Dredging (e.g The Three Gorges Dam)
- Straightening (e.g The Mississippi) - Usually involves explosives! Blowing up meanders to straighten the course of the river, causing it to flow faster. 

## Hard Engineering - The Three Gorges Dam, China

The Three Gorges Dam is a mega-dam located in the province of Hubei on the Yangtze river. The dam is 185m high and has a reservoir that is 632 km long (from London to Edinburgh) and 1.14km wide, making it the world's largest dam and the most expensive, costing ¥180 billion. The dam was constructed in order to control flooding on the Yangtze which has claimed the lives of millions in the past. In addition to this, the Three Gorges Dam will benefit China economically & politically, creating a political talking point. 

## Benefits

### Power Generation

The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric power station, generating 18,2000 MW (roughly 178 nuclear power plants). This meets around 10% of China's energy demands, therefore easing demand on coal and other fossil fuels, benefiting the environment. Currently, China burns through 1.1 - 1.2 billion tons of coal per annum. 

### Improved Navigation

The reservoir created by the dam deepened the Yangtze's channel, sloping the banks and reducing the river's velocity. At the dam, ship lift services allow boats to pass through. The improved navigation will increase the shipping capacity of the river between Yichang and the major industrial city of Chongquing. 

### Water Supply

The dam has the ability to supply the 13 million people of Shanghai and other cities with water. 

## Detrimental Effects

### Environmental Impacts

The altered flow regime downstream of the dam, with reduced patterns of erosion and deposition, could destroy delta downstream. In addition, water temperature and quality will drop downstream of the dam, endangering many species of aquatic animals. Furthermore, in the process of flooding the area behind the dam, many land habitats will have been destroyed, endangering many more species of animal including the Giant Panda and the Chinese tiger.  

### Water Pollution & Disease

The Yangtze is the biggest sewer in all of China. Pollutants from thousands of industrial plants, mining (including “nasty” substances such as arsenic, cyanide and methyl-mercury), residential wastewater and urban sewers (amongst things) drain into the river. Obstructing the river with the dam is going to concentrate the pollutants in a specific area, rather than allowing it to drain and enter the sea (which is bad too!). The removal of annual flooding onto the surrounding farmland will also increase pollution in the river, since farmers will now have to use artificial fertiliser rather than the natural fertiliser provided by deposition during flooding.

## Social Impacts

### Resettlement

Entire towns, such as Wushan, on the confluence of the Yangtze and Daning River, have been submerged by the reservoir from the dam. 1.2 million people have been relocated to newly constructed cities & 300,000 farmers have been given new farmland. 13 new towns & cities have been constructed on higher ground for those who have been displaced, however people's way of life, cultures and traditions have been affected. 

### Archaeological Losses

The region has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic time period and possesses a plethora of archaeological sites. Some sites, such as the Zhang Fei Temple at Yungang have been relocated, 800 sites of interest will be destroyed, greatly effecting tourism in the area. 

### Economic Impacts

Industry will be displaced, though new industry will be generated at a higher cost.

## Engineering Concerns

There are serious questions over the safety of the dam. It's a large target for military strikes and terrorist attacks and, whilst security will be tight, in the event of a war, the Three Gorges Dam will likely be the first target as it provides navigation, electricity and water for a large percentage of China. If the dam was to fail, it would endanger the lives of 350 million people downstream. 

## Soft Engineering Techniques

- River restoration projects.
- Washlands - Creating areas of the river which can be flooded. 
-  Backwaters - A ditch connected to the main channel of a river which the river can flow into during high discharge. 
- Creating new meanders.
- Creating sloping banks - Sloping banks alternate the speed of the river, increasing friction between the channel and the river's water, reducing the speed of the river further downstream. 
- Wetland planting - Planting new plants in the wetlands such as weeping willows, which are “thirsty” plants and will absorb a lot of water.
- Managed retreat - Moving everything out of the path of the river as it erodes a natural course. 
- Afforestation - The planting of trees to increase interception and absorption in the drainage basin. 
- Contour ploughing - Instructing farmers to, on sloped farmland, plough around the slope rather than down the slope, to reduce the volume of water entering the river. 
- Flood plain zoning. 

## Soft Engineering - Restoring the River Cole

The River Cole is located in South England, to the west of Oxford and the north-east of Swindon. A project to restore the river to its original course, which was straightened in the past to improve its efficiency for a grain mill several times,  is being funded by the RPR, the environmental agency, the National Trust & the European Union. The benefits of restoring the river include the reintroduction of wetland, which will provide a habitat for more animals, and fisheries. The restored course will also improve the water quality of the river as more interception and storage of rain water will take place due to the increase in plant life. The restoration is being opposed by local farmers though, as the restoration will replace a large section of farming land with wetland.
