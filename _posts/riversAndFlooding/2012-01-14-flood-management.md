## Hard Engineering Techniques

- Artificial [Levées](/rivers/depositional-features/) (e.g. The Mississippi) - built using soil & rubble all down the Mississippi. 
- Wing Dykes - Dykes narrow the channel of the river, increasing its efficiency and hence its velocity. This has the knock on effect of deepening the channel, increasing its capacity. 
- Cut Offs (e.g. San Gabriel) 
- Deepening (e.g. San Gabriel)
- Revetments (e.g. the Mississippi) - Slopes the sides of the river, increasing friction and slowing the river. 
- Dredging (e.g. The Three Gorges Dam)
- Straightening (e.g. The Mississippi) - Usually involves explosives! Blowing up meanders to straighten the course of the river, causing it to flow faster. 

## Hard Engineering - The Three Gorges Dam, China

The Three Gorges Dam is a mega-dam located in the province of Hubei on the Yangtze river. The dam is 185m high and has a reservoir that is 632 km long (from London to Edinburgh) and 1.14km wide, making it the world's largest dam and the most expensive, costing ¥180 billion. The dam was constructed in order to control flooding on the Yangtze which has claimed the lives of millions in the past. In addition to this, the Three Gorges Dam will benefit China economically & politically, creating a political talking point. 

## Benefits

### Power Generation

The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric power station, generating 18,2000 MW (roughly 178 nuclear power plants). This meets around 10% of China's energy demands, therefore easing demand on coal and other fossil fuels, benefiting the environment. Currently, China burns through 1.1 - 1.2 billion tons of coal per annum. 

### Improved Navigation

The reservoir created by the dam deepened the Yangtze's channel, sloping the banks and reducing the river's velocity. At the dam, ship lift services allow boats to pass through. The improved navigation will increase the shipping capacity of the river between Yichang and the major industrial city of Chongquing. 

### Water Supply

The dam has the ability to supply the 13 million people of Shanghai and other cities with water. 

## Detrimental Effects

### Environmental Impacts

The altered flow regime downstream of the dam, with reduced patterns of erosion and deposition, could destroy delta downstream. In addition, water temperature and quality will drop downstream of the dam, endangering many species of aquatic animals. Furthermore, in the process of flooding the area behind the dam, many land habitats will have been destroyed, endangering many more species of animal including the Giant Panda and the Chinese tiger.  

### Water Pollution & Disease

The Yangtze is the biggest sewer in all of China. Pollutants from thousands of industrial plants, mining (including “nasty” substances such as arsenic, cyanide and methyl-mercury), residential wastewater and urban sewers (amongst things) drain into the river. Obstructing the river with the dam is going to concentrate the pollutants in a specific area, rather than allowing it to drain and enter the sea (which is bad too!). The removal of annual flooding onto the surrounding farmland will also increase pollution in the river, since farmers will now have to use artificial fertiliser rather than the natural fertiliser provided by deposition during flooding.

## Social Impacts

### Resettlement

Entire towns, such as Wushan, on the confluence of the Yangtze and Daning River, have been submerged by the reservoir from the dam. 1.2 million people have been relocated to newly constructed cities & 300,000 farmers have been given new farmland. 13 new towns & cities have been constructed on higher ground for those who have been displaced, however people's way of life, cultures and traditions have been affected. 

### Archaeological Losses

The region has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic time period and possesses a plethora of archaeological sites. Some sites, such as the Zhang Fei Temple at Yungang have been relocated, 800 sites of interest will be destroyed, greatly effecting tourism in the area. 

### Economic Impacts

Industry will be displaced, though new industry will be generated at a higher cost.

## Engineering Concerns

There are serious questions over the safety of the dam. It's a large target for military strikes and terrorist attacks and, whilst security will be tight, in the event of a war, the Three Gorges Dam will likely be the first target as it provides navigation, electricity and water for a large percentage of China. If the dam was to fail, it would endanger the lives of 350 million people downstream. 

## Soft Engineering Techniques

- River restoration projects.
- Washlands - Creating areas of the river which can be flooded. 
-  Backwaters - A ditch connected to the main channel of a river which the river can flow into during high discharge. 
- Creating new meanders.
- Creating sloping banks - Sloping banks alternate the speed of the river, increasing friction between the channel and the river's water, reducing the speed of the river further downstream. 
- Wetland planting - Planting new plants in the wetlands such as weeping willows, which are “thirsty” plants and will absorb a lot of water.
- Managed retreat - Moving everything out of the path of the river as it erodes a natural course. 
- Afforestation - The planting of trees to increase interception and absorption in the drainage basin. 
- Contour ploughing - Instructing farmers to, on sloped farmland, plough around the slope rather than down the slope, to reduce the volume of water entering the river. 
- Flood plain zoning. 

## Soft Engineering - Restoring the River Cole

The River Cole is located in South England, to the west of Oxford and the north-east of Swindon. A project to restore the river to its original course, which was straightened in the past to improve its efficiency for a grain mill several times,  is being funded by the RPR, the environmental agency, the National Trust & the European Union. The benefits of restoring the river include the reintroduction of wetland, which will provide a habitat for more animals, and fisheries. The restored course will also improve the water quality of the river as more interception and storage of rain water will take place due to the increase in plant life. The restoration is being opposed by local farmers though, as the restoration will replace a large section of farming land with wetland. 

## Soft Engineering vs Hard Engineering

Below is an essay I wrote which discusses the advantages and disadvantages of hard (and briefly soft) engineering, referring to several of the case studies from above. It's actually an answer to a [past paper question](http://store.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/pdf/AQA-GEOG1-W-QP-JAN10.PDF):

Hard engineering is the process of artificially altering the course and properties of a river in an attempt to control it’s flow and reduce the possibility and/or impact of flooding. Hard engineering, whilst generally effective, often damages the environment, is economically unsound and can, on occasions, cause questionable human rights issues. There are a variety of methods of hard engineering, damming a river, straightening the course of a river and artificial levées are common methods of hard engineering. 

Damming is the process of blocking a river with, essentially, a large wall, creating a reservoir behind the dam and allowing the amount of water that flows downstream to be controlled, thus reducing the river’s ability to flood. Dams are a good example of hard engineering, they are large man made structures that are incredibly effective at controlling the flow of a river and they can have large environmental, economic & social impacts. One of the most prominent dams in recent history, the Three Gorges Dam, on the Yangtze in China, is a perfect example. The Three Gorges Dam is the world’s largest, coming in at 185m high. It has a reservoir that is 630km long and has multiple purposes. The primary purpose is to control flooding on the Yangtze river which has claimed many hundreds of thousands of lives in the past. The dam doubles as a source of electricity via hydroelectric power, it’s thought to be able to generate nearly 10% of China’s electricity. This proves to be an environmental advantage of the dam as it will aid in reducing China’s high dependence on coal and hence reduce its carbon emissions. The dam is thought to, at peak efficiency, reduce coal consumption by 31 million tonnes, which will also lower sulfur, carbon and other chemical emissions. 

Unfortunately, the environmental benefit of this clean power generation could be outweighed by the negative effects of damming the Three Gorges Dam, or any other river. Damming the river is going to alter the temperature of the water further downstream. This can prove fatal for many species of aquatic life and can lead to the extinction of many species of rare animals. As mentioned above, a large area behind the dam must be flooded which, again, endangers animals as habitats are totally destroyed by the flooding process. In the case of the Three Gorges Dam, the already endangered Giant Panda is going to be threatened further due to a large section of its habitat being flooded. 

Besides threatening many species of animals, the dam represents a serious problem in terms of pollution, which could counteract the reduction in pollution from the generation of electricity through HEP. Ignoring the amount of dust that will have entered the atmosphere & river during the dam’s construction, there are concerns that pollution in the Yangtze, China’s largest “sewer”, could pool behind the dam, creating an area with a high concentration of pollution and potentially poisoning water supplies.

The dam does bring some economical benefits. Whilst this isn’t true for all dams, the Three Gorges Dam will help aid navigability of the Yangtze river as the reservoir created by the dam will help deepen the Yangtze’s channel and reduce it’s velocity, making it easier for ships to navigate the river. The dam itself also features a ship-lift service in order to allow ships to pass the dam. The dam will increase the shipping capacity of the river between Yichang and the major industrial city of Chongquing. These economic benefits will hopefully help pay for the incredibly high cost of the Dam, ¥180 billion. This high cost is characteristic of many hard engineering techniques, especially dams.

The final impact of the Three Gorges Dam is, arguably, the most significant. The social impacts of the dam have been huge. The 630km reservoir behind the dam has resulted in the displacement of 1.2 million people from their homes. The Chinese government has moved these people to 13 specially constructed cities on higher ground due to old cities, towns & villages being flooded. While these new cities include modern housing complexes, it’s unlikely that people from small villages will have wanted to leave, they didn’t have any choice however. Many cultural sites have also been destroyed due to the flooding behind the dam. Family burial sites are destroyed along with ancient temples and relics. While some are being relocated, 800 sites of interest are being destroyed. 

Dams are amazing pieces of engineering and they prove to be incredibly effective at controlling the flow of the river and have been shown to reduce the risk of flooding substantially. They can also bring major economic benefits to cities by improving the navigability of rivers and by generating clean & safe energy for the future expansion of cities. This comes at a great cost however. They are incredibly expensive to build; only the richest countries can afford them. They can create serious environmental problems, causing the extinction of many species of animals and plants and, most importantly, they often disrupt communities. They require the relocation of thousands of people so that an area behind the dam can be flooded and made useless. They are very effective at controlling a river and stopping flooding but they are very disruptive on the lives of people and the environment. 

An alternative hard engineering technique is the straightening of a river. Essentially, the sinuosity of the river is reduced by cutting of meanders and creating new, straighter courses for the river to flow through. This increases the velocity that the river can flow at and, as a result, deepens the channel, increasing the river’s capacity. The technique of straightening was used on the Mississippi, which floods annually in spring due to an influx of melt water as ice melts. Straightening the river was, at first, thought to be an effective way of preventing the river from flooding without constructing large dams. It was less destructive than damming, and was also cheaper. It soon became apparent on the Mississippi though that straightening hadn’t been effective when the Mississippi flooded again. While straightening the Mississippi had reduced flooding upstream, flooding had been exacerbated downstream and extreme amounts of damage were caused as a result. The impacts of this were largely social and economic, the destruction of homes and businesses. 

As straightening a river increases its velocity, the river’s ability to erode is also greatly increased. The river will erode its banks much quicker which presents problems for people living on the banks of the river as their homes could potentially fall into the river due to the erosion of the banks. Straightening can also cause the small scale destruction of habitats due to both the increased erosion and the removal of meanders. 

The final technique commonly employed as a method of hard engineering is the construction of (artificial) levées. Again, levées were constructed all along the Mississippi out of dirt, mud etc. The levées greatly increase the capacity of a river, allowing it to store more water without flooding but they only prove effective to a certain point. It’s not possible to dynamically increase the height of levées (efficiently) if the river is close to overflowing the levées meaning they can only really defend against small floods. Very rare floods (1 in 200 years) will easily overcome levées as building levées high enough to contain the river during these incredibly high levels of discharge would be difficult, expensive and is often viewed as unnecessary due to the rarity of such floods. When the river gets past levées is when the disadvantages of levées really become apparent. As levées are holding back a significant amount of water, when they burst they release a lot of water quickly, causing significant damage structurally to buildings due to the high velocity of the flood water. In addition, levées can increase the time it takes to clean up after a flood as the flood water can’t return to it’s channel easily (since the levées are obstructing it). This can further worsen the economic costs of cleaning up after a flood as the flood water must then be pumped back into the river. 

Overall, hard engineering offers a specific set of advantages and a large set of disadvantages when it comes to flood management. While hard engineering is incredibly effective in comparison to soft engineering and offers a lot of control over the river in terms of controlling its flow, hard engineering is very expensive and normally causes great damage to the environment and habitats. It also often interferes with peoples lives, sometimes forcing people to move from their homes in order to accommodate the new structures that have to be built. One of the biggest problems with hard engineering though is the immense damage that can be caused if the engineering is to fail. A dam houses vast quantities of water behind it and if it should fail structurally, it would cause devastating floods. Straightening of rivers, while effective upstream of the river, worsens flooding downstream of the river, as the water is flowing at a much higher velocity. Weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of hard engineering, it would seem that most hard engineering techniques are best suited as a last resort method of controlling the river due to the effects they have and soft engineering techniques should be considered first.
