Features Of Erosion
------------------

### Potholes

Potholes are cylindrical holes drilled into the bed (the bed must consist of hard rock) of the river. Pebbles are trapped in small hollows and vertical eddies (a circular movement of water, counter to the flow of the river, causing a miniature whirl pool) in the water are strong enough to allow the sediment to grind a hole into the bed through abrasion. Potholes vary in size from a few centimetres to several metres. They are generally found in the upper or early middle course. This is where the river lies well above base level and so has the most potential energy for downcutting. This is also where the river bed is more likely to be rocky in nature. Examples of potholes include the Strid on the River Wharf and in the Afon Glaslyn, Snowdonia. 

### V Shaped Valleys

After a period of heavy rainfall, turbulence between the river's bedrock increases due to an increase in discharge. This causes the bedrock to be transported by traction, increasing the vertical erosion of the river. The river doesn't carry out much horizontal erosion since it has a large wetted perimeter and so must use its energy to overcome friction with its load. Alongside the vertical erosion, the sides of the valley are weathered and loose rock fragments due to mass wasting, causing the valley to take up a v shape. The steepness of the valley sides depends upon the climate (there needs to be a lot of rain), rock structure (resistant or not) and vegetation (plant roots help bind the valley sides' soil). Rivers in upland areas must wind around protrusions leading to the formation of interlocking spurs. 

### Waterfalls (Geological)

Waterfalls are the result of a river flowing over rock that goes from hard rock to soft rock. The river erodes the soft rock vertically but not the hard rock causing a sudden drop in the gradient of the river. As the water falls down the drop formed by the erosion of the soft rock it forms a plunge pool. Splashback from the plunge pool erodes headwards and undercuts the hard rock forming a cap rock. This, eventually collapses and falls into the plunge pool leaving a gorge of recession. 

###Rapids

Rapids form in a similar way to waterfalls. They form when there is a sudden drop in the gradient of the river. They also form in areas of alternating bands of hard and soft rock. Rapids increase the turbulence of the river and so the river's erosive power.
