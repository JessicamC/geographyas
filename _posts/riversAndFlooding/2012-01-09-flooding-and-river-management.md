Flooding occurs when a river's discharge exceeds the capacity of its channel causing it to overflow its banks. 

## Causes

### Natural Causes

- Excessive precipitation saturating the ground, preventing infiltration and so causing overland flow. 
- Intense precipitation which occurs faster than the ground can absorb precipitation, leading to overland flow. 
- Meltwater from snow flowing into a river can increase its discharge. 
- Climatic hazards such as hurricanes and cyclones which create intense amounts of precipitation. 
- Steep slopes increase the speed at which water can enter the river increasing the river's peak discharge causing it to exceed its capacity. 
- Impermeable rocks decrease infiltration  and increase surface run off so that more water enters the river. 

### Unnatural causes

- Urbanisation reduces infiltration and increases surface run off due to the increase in impermeable surfaces. 
- Deforestation reduces interception and absorption, increasing the amount of water entering the river. A lack of trees to bind the soil also increases mass wasting into the river. This, in turn, will reduce the capacity of the river and result in lower discharge levels causing the river to flood. 
- Changes in land usage can effect the amount of water entering the river. 

## The Recurrence Interval	

Hydrologists try and forecast the likelihood of floods by looking at past records of river peak discharges and the years that they occurred in. Using this data, they can calculate the *recurrence interval* of a flood of a specific scale. 

> "Recurrence Interval" = ("Number Of Years On Record" + 1) / "Ranking Of Flood"
> 
> Recurrence Interval = (n + 1) ÷ m

For example, a flood with a discharge of 18m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> which was ranked the 12th largest flood has a recurrence interval of:

> (40+1) ÷ 12 = 3.42 (Years)

We therefore expect this river to have a discharge of 18m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> every 3.42 years. 

### Criticisms Of The Recurrence Interval

- It's entirely dependent upon the size of the record (the number of years on record). 
- Extreme events that are possible within a longer time period appear as anomalies yet in a wider record, they would not be so unexpected. 
- The occurrence of a large flood does not mean it cannot occur again for a given time since recurrence intervals are just averages. 
- Past data being used to calculate the probability of future events may have been produced under very different environmental condition than contemporary data. For example, due to global warming, data obtained in the past will no longer be as reliable. 

## Flooding in an MEDC - 2004 Boscastle Floods

Boscastle, located in the southwest of England, on the west coast of Cornwall, experienced torrential rain and flash floods on August the 16<sup>th</sup>, 2004 at midday. Thunderclouds developed over the southwest of England, the remnants of Hurricane Alex and the intense heating of the surface in the summer heat, evaporating massive amounts of water. The rain began to fall minutes later in a localised storm over high ground located inland of Boscastle. Soon after the rain started, a flood warning was issued. The rain continued for hours. At its peak, 24.1mm of rain fell in just 15 minutes at Lesnweth and 89mm was recorded in an hour in Boscastle. At 15:30, over two hours since the storm began, the River Valency burst its banks after rising 2m in height. This caused water to start pooling behind debris caught under a bridge. When the bridge collapsed, a 3m wave, that travelled at 4ms<sup>-1</sup> was unleashed, causing extensive structural damage. At 5pm, the flood had reached its peak level and extensive damage had been inflicted upon properties and vehicles. A helicopter rescue operation launched just a few hours earlier continued until 2:30am. The operation rescued 150 people.  

The River Valency was able to flood so easily for a variety of reason. The localised storm formed over a highland area known as Bodmin Moor. This area is mainly composed of impermeable rocks such as a shale and slate and lacks vegetation, increasing surface run off in the area due to a lack of infiltration (due to the impermeable rock) and a lack of interception and absorption. This, combined with the high relief in the area, caused the rainwater to enter surrounding streams very quickly. The River Valency has a high drainage density, so a lot of these streams led into the river, ultimately increasing its discharge. The land surrounding the River Valency had been saturated by previous heavy rainfall, reducing the ability for water to infiltrate into the ground and so increasing surface run off into the river further. The narrow valley surrounding the River Valency helped to speed up the water's speed as it was funnelled through the valley, increasing the likelihood that the river would burst its banks. This all lead to the River Valency experiencing a level of discharge substantially higher than its capacity. As it forms a confluence with the River Jordan in Boscastle, which will have been experiencing similar effects, the rivers overflowed and burst their banks, flooding the surrounding area of Boscastle.

As the floodplain surrounding the rivers had been urbanised, water was unable to infiltrate the asphalt, leading to an increase in discharge in the rivers and also increasing the resulting damage from when the river did flood, since buildings were located on the flood plain. The channels flowing through Boscastle had been walled off. This stopped the river from adjusting to the increased discharge during the heavy rainfall and limited its efficiency, causing it to flood.

Due to well executed rescue operations, nobody was reported as dead or seriously injured. The floods still caused extensive structural damage however. 75 cars, 5 caravans and 6 buildings were washed out to sea as well as several boats. The large number of cars was largely due to the low altitude of the car park which allowed the flood water to flow into the car park and wash away the cars. Close to 100 homes and businesses were destroyed with debris being spread over a large section of the area. The main section of the “lower bridge” was also destroyed when debris became stuck behind it, causing water to build up. When the bridge was destroyed, the water released caused more damage to the surrounding buildings. 

Short term responses to the flood included a search and rescue party being sent out within hours of the flood. Cars, trees and other debris were removed from the roads and a temporary fix to the damaged lower bridge was set up. By September, work had begun on an overflow culvert, to help divert the flow of the water. In early 2005, the majority of shops had reopened. The water supply was restored later in 2005, along with a new power supply (which had been taken out during the thunderstorm). The local council helped to strengthen the flood defence systems and the town was deemed “rebuilt”. In 2006, work on widening and lowering the channel began, in an attempt to increase the capacity of the river so that it can deal with sudden increases increases in discharge better. Finally, in recent years, the lower bridge was demolished and a new bridge was constructed which is less likely to be blocked off with debris should the river flood gain. In June 2007, the river flooded again however due to these improved flood defence systems and the altered channel, the damage was minimised. 

Overall, there was a peak discharge of 140m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> on August the 16<sup>th</sup> between 5 and 6pm. The flood caused millions of pounds in damages with each insurance claiming costing between £15,000 to £30,000 per property. The probability of a flood like this occurring is 1 in 400 years, with the probability of such extensive rainfall being even lower, at 1 in 1300 per year. 

## Flooding in an LEDC - 2008 Bihar Floods

### Location & Causes

Bihar is located in the north east of India, to the south of the Himalayas. During the months of August and September 2008 there was a long period of heavy rainfall on the foothills of the Himalayas. The rainfall was due to the seasonal reversal of winds in the area, leading to monsoons. The rainfall in the foothills entered the River Kosi, a tributary to the Ganges, and rapidly increased its volume, forcing it to flow into an old course that it hadn't flown through in over 100 years. The area surrounding the river had also been deforested, reducing interception and absorption and hence increasing the volume of water entering the river, causing it to flood. 

### Effects

- The flood killed over 400 people and effected nearly 2.3 million people. 
- Massive food shortages. 70% of the population where subsistence farmers but the floods put 100,000 Ha of farmland under water, destroying crops. This led to undernourishment in the following months, increasing the spread of disease and hence increasing the total number of fatalities. 
- Food shortages and an abundance of flood water meant that disease spread incredibly quickly. 
- Houses, farms and roads where destroyed making it nearly impossible to gain access to the area. 

### Responses

- Charities such as the Red Cross helped build shelters; supply food, fresh water and medicines; and rebuild embankments on the River Kosi. 
- The Indian government gave £115 million in aid and released 125 tonnes of emergency grain. 
- The Indian airforce airlifted 400,000 people to safety. 
- Impacts on the economy of both Bihar and India as a whole. 

## River Management

### Hard Engineering Techniques

- Artificial [Levées](/rivers/depositional-features/) (e.g. The Mississippi) - built using soil & rubble all down the Mississippi. 
- Wing Dykes - Dykes narrow the channel of the river, increasing its efficiency and hence its velocity. This has the knock on effect of deepening the channel, increasing its capacity. 
- Cut Offs (e.g. San Gabriel) 
- Deepening (e.g. San Gabriel)
- Revetments (e.g. the Mississippi) - Slopes the sides of the river, increasing friction and slowing the river. 
- Dredging (e.g. The Three Gorges Dam)
- Straightening (e.g. The Mississippi) - Usually involves explosives! Blowing up meanders to straighten the course of the river, causing it to flow faster. 

### Hard Engineering - The Three Gorges Dam, China

The Three Gorges Dam is a mega-dam located in the province of Hubei on the Yangtze river. The dam is 185m high and has a reservoir that is 632 km long (from London to Edinburgh) and 1.14km wide, making it the world's largest dam and the most expensive, costing ¥180 billion. The dam was constructed in order to control flooding on the Yangtze which has claimed the lives of millions in the past. In addition to this, the Three Gorges Dam will benefit China economically & politically, creating a political talking point. 

### Benefits

#### Power Generation

The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric power station, generating 18,2000 MW (roughly 178 nuclear power plants). This meets around 10% of China's energy demands, therefore easing demand on coal and other fossil fuels, benefiting the environment. Currently, China burns through 1.1 - 1.2 billion tons of coal per annum. 

#### Improved Navigation

The reservoir created by the dam deepened the Yangtze's channel, sloping the banks and reducing the river's velocity. At the dam, ship lift services allow boats to pass through. The improved navigation will increase the shipping capacity of the river between Yichang and the major industrial city of Chongquing. 

#### Water Supply

The dam has the ability to supply the 13 million people of Shanghai and other cities with water. 

### Detrimental Effects

#### Environmental Impacts

The altered flow regime downstream of the dam, with reduced patterns of erosion and deposition, could destroy delta downstream. In addition, water temperature and quality will drop downstream of the dam, endangering many species of aquatic animals. Furthermore, in the process of flooding the area behind the dam, many land habitats will have been destroyed, endangering many more species of animal including the Giant Panda and the Chinese tiger.  

#### Water Pollution & Disease

The Yangtze is the biggest sewer in all of China. Pollutants from thousands of industrial plants, mining (including “nasty” substances such as arsenic, cyanide and methyl-mercury), residential wastewater and urban sewers (amongst things) drain into the river. Obstructing the river with the dam is going to concentrate the pollutants in a specific area, rather than allowing it to drain and enter the sea (which is bad too!). The removal of annual flooding onto the surrounding farmland will also increase pollution in the river, since farmers will now have to use artificial fertiliser rather than the natural fertiliser provided by deposition during flooding.

### Social Impacts

#### Resettlement

Entire towns, such as Wushan, on the confluence of the Yangtze and Daning River, have been submerged by the reservoir from the dam. 1.2 million people have been relocated to newly constructed cities & 300,000 farmers have been given new farmland. 13 new towns & cities have been constructed on higher ground for those who have been displaced, however people's way of life, cultures and traditions have been affected. 

#### Archaeological Losses

The region has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic time period and possesses a plethora of archaeological sites. Some sites, such as the Zhang Fei Temple at Yungang have been relocated, 800 sites of interest will be destroyed, greatly effecting tourism in the area. 

#### Economic Impacts

Industry will be displaced, though new industry will be generated at a higher cost.

### Engineering Concerns

There are serious questions over the safety of the dam. It's a large target for military strikes and terrorist attacks and, whilst security will be tight, in the event of a war, the Three Gorges Dam will likely be the first target as it provides navigation, electricity and water for a large percentage of China. If the dam was to fail, it would endanger the lives of 350 million people downstream. 

### Soft Engineering Techniques

- River restoration projects.
- Washlands - Creating areas of the river which can be flooded. 
- Backwaters - A ditch connected to the main channel of a river which the river can flow into during high discharge. 
- Creating new meanders.
- Creating sloping banks - Sloping banks alternate the speed of the river, increasing friction between the channel and the river's water, reducing the speed of the river further downstream. 
- Wetland planting - Planting new plants in the wetlands such as weeping willows, which are “thirsty” plants and will absorb a lot of water.
- Managed retreat - Moving everything out of the path of the river as it erodes a natural course. 
- Afforestation - The planting of trees to increase interception and absorption in the drainage basin. 
- Contour ploughing - Instructing farmers to, on sloped farmland, plough around the slope rather than down the slope, to reduce the volume of water entering the river. 
- Flood plain zoning. 

### Soft Engineering - Restoring the River Cole

The River Cole is located in South England, to the west of Oxford and the north-east of Swindon. A project to restore the river to its original course, which was straightened in the past to improve its efficiency for a grain mill several times,  is being funded by the RPR, the environmental agency, the National Trust & the European Union. The benefits of restoring the river include the reintroduction of wetland, which will provide a habitat for more animals, and fisheries. The restored course will also improve the water quality of the river as more interception and storage of rain water will take place due to the increase in plant life. The restoration is being opposed by local farmers though, as the restoration will replace a large section of farming land with wetland.
