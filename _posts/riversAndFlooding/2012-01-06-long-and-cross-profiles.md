### The Long Profile

### Long Profile Key Terms

- _Knick Point_ - Products of rejuvenation. 
- _Graded Profile_ - Smooth concave shape.
- _Profile of dynamic equilibrium_ - Balance between erosion and deposition.
- _Potential Energy_ - Stored energy (e.g. GPE).
- _Kinetic Energy_ - Energy due to movement. 

Cross Profiles
--------------

#### Upper Course

- In the upper course, the river's valley is V shaped. The channel is not very wide (although the valley is), around 2m. The channel is relatively deep due to a large amount of vertical erosion thanks to the transportation of large pieces of load through traction. 

#### Middle Course

- The channel is slightly wider in the middle course (10m) and the valley is substantially wider (3-4km). The channel is also slightly deeper.

#### Lower Course

- The channel is wider again, around 1km now. The valley is also wider, around 10km. The channel is deeper again. 

### Channel Efficiency

> Hydraulic Radius = Cross Sectional Area (m<sup>2</sup>) / Wetted perimeter(m)

>This can be represented as: R = A/Pw

A very efficient channel has a large hydraulic radius. The large hydraulic radius indicates that there is little friction between water and the sides of the channel, allowing it to flow more easily as it doesn't loose energy to the river channel.

### Channel Velocity

- The highest velocity is recorded in the centre of the river channel, just below the surface. This is the area where there is minimal friction with the air (at the surface) and the bed/banks.

- _Thalweg_ - The point of the river with the highest velocity.
