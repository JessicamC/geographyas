## Potholes

Potholes are cylindrical holes drilled into the bed of a river. They vary in diameter from just a few centimetres to several metres and the largest potholes are several metres deep. Potholes form when pebbles become trapped in small hollows and vertical eddies (a circular current of water counter to the flow of the river) develop, drilling the pebble into the bed and eroding the bed by corrasion, producing a hole that grows as the pebble erodes it. In order for the pebble to erode the bed the pebble needs to be _at least_ as hard as the rock that makes up the river bed, if not harder otherwise it won’t have any effect and instead the pebble will be eroded. 

Potholes are features found mainly in the upper course of the river as this is where the river has the most gravitational potential energy and so the greatest ability to erode vertically. In addition, the river is more turbulent in the upper course so it is more likely to create the eddies needed to drill the pebbles into the bed.

## V-Shaped Valleys

V-Shaped valleys are found in the upper course of the river and are a result of both erosion by the river and weathering. V-Shaped valleys are deep river valleys with steep sides that look like a letter V when a cross section of them is taken, hence the name. They’re found in the upper course because this is where the river has the greatest gravitational potential energy and so the greatest potential to erode vertically. It does so during periods of high discharge. When the river’s discharge is high, it is able to transport its large bedload by traction eroding the river’s bed and valley by corrasion, deepening it. Not much lateral erosion takes place so the channel and valley remains relatively narrow. 

As the channel and valley deepens the sides of the valley are exposed and become susceptible to weathering. The valley’s sides also undergo mass movements resulting in large volumes of material falling into the river’s channel, adding to its erosive power and causing the valley sides to take up a V shape. The steepness of the valley sides and whether the valley actually looks like a V is dependent on the climate, vegetation and rock structure among things. In cold, wet climates, freeze thaw weathering is abundant and rainwater can act as a lubricant, aiding mass movements. Vegetation can impede mass movements because it will help bind the soil. If the valley is composed of hard rock the valley sides will be very steep because they won’t be weathered easily.

## Waterfalls (Geological)

Waterfalls develop when a change of lithology takes place in the river’s course resulting in differential erosion taking place. When the rock type of the river’s channel changes from hard rock to soft rock, the river erodes the soft rock faster than the hard rock (differential erosion) producing a sudden drop in the gradient of the river with the hard rock being higher up than the soft rock. As the river flows over the hard rock, it falls onto the soft rock with a considerable amount of force, eroding the soft rock and creating a greater height difference between the hard and soft rock, producing the waterfall. As the water flows over the waterfall, it carves out a _plunge pool_ via corrasion and erodes & undercuts the hard rock via a process called _splashback_. As the hard rock is undercut, a cap rock is produced. This is a chunk of hard rock that the river flows over before flowing over the waterfall that is unsupported as it has been undercut by splashback. The cap rock is unstable and will eventually collapse into the plunge pool causing the waterfall to retreat. Over thousands of years, the repeated process of the collapse of a cap rock and the retreat of the waterfall produces a _gorge of recession_.

## Rapids

Rapids are sections of a river where the gradient of the river bed is relatively steep resulting in an increase in the river’s turbulence and velocity. They form where the gradient of the river is steep and the bed is composed mainly of hard rocks. 

## Meanders

Meanders are bends in a river that form as a river’s sinuosity increases. The sinuosity of a river is a measurement of how much a river varies from a straight line. It’s a ratio between the channel length and displacement (straight line distance) between two points in the river’s course:

\\[ \text{Sinuosity} = \frac{\text{Channel Length}}{\text{Displacement}} \\]

A sinuosity of 1 means that the channel is perfectly straight. A sinuosity greater than 1 means that the river meanders.

Meanders develop when alternating riffles & pools form along a river channel. A riffle is a a shallow section of a channel while a pool is a deep section. These riffles and pools develop at equal points along the river channel with each pool being about 5× the length of the channel. 

In a pool, the channel is more efficient while at a riffle, the channel is less efficient. This causes the flow of the river to become irregular and the maximum flow is concentrated on one side of the river. This increases erosion on one side of the river and increases deposition on the other causing the river’s channel to appear to bend. Erosion is greatest on the outside bend and deposition is greatest on the inside bend.

![][riffles-and-pools-diagram]

The alternating riffles & pools have another affect, they increase the turbulence of the river and produce a special type  of flow known as _helicoidal_ flow. This is a corkscrew like movement which spirals from one side of the channel to another between pools. The helicoidal flow erodes the pools along the channel and increases deposition on the next inside bend after a pool. 

### Characteristics

A cross section of a meander would show that on the outside bend, the channel is very deep and concave. This is because the outside bend is where the river flows fastest and is most energetic, so lots of erosion by hydraulic action and corrasion takes place. _River cliffs_ form on the outside bend as the river erodes laterally. The inside bend is shallower with a gentle _slip-off slope_ made of sand or shingle that is brought across from the outside bend by the helicoidal flow of the river. The river flows much slower on the inside bend so some deposition takes place, contribution to the slip-off slope.

## Braided Channels

A braided channel is a type of channel that is divided into smaller sub-channels by small, temporary islands called _eyots_. Braided channels develop in rivers with a lot of sedimentary load, a steep gradient and where the discharge of the river changes regularly. When the volume of load exceeds the river’s capacity or the discharge of the river drops, the river is forced to deposit its load in the channel and islands of sediment (eyots) form.

## Floodplains

Floodplains are large, flat expanses of land that form on either side of a river. The floodplain is the area that a river floods onto when it’s experiencing high discharge. When a river floods, its efficiency decreases rapidly because of an increase in friction, reducing the river’s velocity and forcing it to deposit its load. The load is deposited across the floodplain as _alluvium_. The alluvium is very fertile so floodplains are often used as farmland. 

The width of a floodplain is determined by the sinuosity of the river and how much meander migration takes place. If there’s a lot of meander migration, the area that the river floods on will change and the floodplain will become wider.

## Levees

Levees are natural embankments produced, ironically, when a river floods. When a river floods, it deposits its load over the flood plain due to a dramatic drop in the river’s velocity as friction increases greatly. The largest & heaviest load is deposited first and closest to the river bank, often on the very edge, forming raised mounds. The finer material is deposited further away from the banks causing the mounds to appear to taper off. Repeated floods cause the mounds to build up and form levees. 

Levees aren’t permanent structures. Once the river’s discharge exceeds its bankfull discharge[^1], the levees can be burst by the high pressure of the water. Levees increase the height of the river’s channel though, so the bankfull discharge is increased and it becomes more difficult for the river to flood.

## Oxbow Lakes

Oxbow lakes develop from meanders that have undergone extensive deposition. The neck of a meander gradually narrows as a result of deposition on the inside bend. During periods of high discharge, a river will break across a meander’s neck so that it can take the fastest route until discharge returns to normal levels. Over time, the neck of the meander will narrow until the meander is blocked off by deposition causing the river to assume a new, straighter course and leaving the remains of the meander as an oxbow lake. Ultimately, the lake will dry up and a _meander scar_ will be all that is left.

## Deltas

Deltas are depositional landforms found at the mouth of a river where the river meets a body of water with a lower velocity than the river (e.g. a lake or the sea). The body of water must be relatively quiet and stable with a low tidal range so that deposited sediment isn’t washed away and can instead build up. 

When a river meets a stationary body of water, its velocity falls causing any material being transported by the river to be deposited. Deltas are made up of three sediment beds that have been sorted by the size of the sediment. The bottom most bed, the _bottomset_ bed, is composed primarily of clay and fine grained sediments because when clay meets salt water a process called flocculation takes place where clay & salt particles clump together (flocculate) due to an electrostatic charge developing between the particles. This makes the clay particles sink due to their increased weight producing the bottomset bed. The bottomset bed stretches a fair distance from the mouth of the river as the fine sediments can be transported a reasonable distance from the river’s mouth.

The foreset bed is the next bed that develops on top of the bottomset bed. The foreset bed is composed of coarser sediments that are deposited due to a fall in the river’s velocity and aren’t transported very far into the stationary body of water that the river flows into. The foreset bed makes up the majority of the delta and is dipped towards deep water in the direction that the river is flowing in. 

The topset bed is the topmost bed of the delta. It is also composed of coarse sediment but, unlike the foreset bed, the topset bed isn’t dipped and is purely horizontal.

![][delta-bedding-layers]

Deltas can take on many different shapes. The three primary shapes of delta are _cuspate_, _arcuate_ and _bird’s foot_.

Arcuate deltas (e.g. The Nile Delta, Egypt) are shaped like a triangle (which is where the term delta comes from, the Greek letter delta Δ) and form when a river meets a sea with alternating current directions that shape the delta so that it looks like a triangle.

![The Nile Delta][nile-delta-gmaps]

Cuspate deltas (e.g. Ebro Delta, Spain) are vaguely shaped like a V with curved sides. Cuspate deltas form when a river flows into a sea with waves that hit it head on, spreading the deposited sediment out.

![The Ebro Delta][ebro-delta-gmaps]

Bird’s foot deltas (e.g. The Mississippi Delta) are shaped like (as the name suggests) a bird’s foot. They extend reasonably far into a body of water and form when the river’s current is stronger than the sea’s waves. Bird’s foot deltas are uncommon because there are very few areas where a sea’s waves are weaker than a river’s current.
