<h3 id='key_terms'>Key Terms</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Regime</em> - The regime is the variation in the discharge of water carried by the river at different times of year.</li>

<li><em>Discharge</em> - The volume of water passing the gauging station of a river in a given time. Measured in cumecs or mÂ³/s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='drainage_basin_shape'>Drainage Basin Shape</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Size</em> - If the basin is small it will not take long for the rainfall to meet the main channel.</li>

<li><em>Shape</em> - If the drainage basin is elongated it will take longer for rainfall to reach the main channel. If it is circular in shape, all points are equidistant from the channel and so it will have a shorter lag time and higher peak flow.</li>

<li><em>Relief</em> - In steep-sided upland valleys, water will reach the river more quickly than gentle sloping lowland areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='controls_in_a_drainage_basin'>Controls In A Drainage Basin</h3>

<ul>
<li>Prolonged rainfall causes flooding as a result of the ground becoming saturated.</li>

<li>Intense rain causes flash floods as water is unable to infiltrate the ground quickly, increasing surface run off.</li>

<li>Heavy snowfall causes lots of water to be stored so that when it melts the meltwater quickly enters the river.</li>

<li>Extremes in temperature effect the amount of infiltration and evaporation rates.</li>

<li>Vegetation reduces discharge into a river by intercepting rainwater and absorbing it too before loosing it though transpiration.</li>

<li>Porous and non-porous rocks effect a storm hydrograph as the porous rocks contain holes which can store water, reducing the rivers discharge.</li>

<li>The drainage density of a river effects discharge and the storm hydrograph massively.</li>

<li>A high drainage density will result in a much higher discharge for the river.</li>

<li>A high tide will prevent the rive from entering the sea causing the water to build up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='the_river_lambourn_compared_to_the_river_kent'>The River Lambourn Compared to The River Kent</h3>

<p>The river Lambourn&#8217;s peak discharge occurs in late January/early February when the discharge is around 5m^3|s-1. Throughout the remainder of the year, the river&#8217;s discharge falls to around 1m^3|s-1 in mid October. The rivers discharge then begins to rise again. The River Kent&#8217;s discharge is far less stable with discharge levels fluctuating between the months going from 3m^3|s-1 in October to 100m^3|s-1 in the same month. These discharge levels are much higher than the River Lambourn&#8217;s likely due to the high annual rainfall near the River Kent of 1,732mm (996mm more than the River Lambourn&#8217;s). The steep increase in discharge for the River Kent is likely due to the high relief of 817m causing large amounts of water to enter the river quickly.</p>
