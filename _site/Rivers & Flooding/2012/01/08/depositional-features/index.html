<h3 id='braided_channels'>Braided Channels</h3>

<p>Braided channels occur in rivers with lots of load, a steep gradient and where the course and discharge of the river fluctuate daily or annually. Rivers with a large volume of load and high discharge experience flash floods in arid areas or are swollen with water in cold climates. In these types of areas there is little vegetation so erosion of the load is rapid. In these rivers deposition occurs in the form of sand and gravel islands that divide the channel into smaller channels as the river navigates its large bed load.</p>
