<h2 id='river_processes'>River Processes</h2>

<p><em>Erosion</em> - The break up and removal of rocks by the action of rock particles being moved over the surface by water, wind or ice.</p>

<p><em>The Weight Of The Water</em> - The greater the mass of the water the more energy it will possess due to the influence of gravity on its movement.</p>

<p><em>The height of the river above sea level</em> - This gives the river a source of potential energy. The higher the source of the river the more energy it has.</p>

<p><em>The steepness of the channel</em> - This controls the speed of the river which determines how much kinetic energy it has.</p>

<h3 id='erosion_processes'>Erosion Processes</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Corrasion</em> - Load is dragged along the bed of the river eroding it like sand paper.</li>

<li><em>Corrosion</em> - The acidic nature of the water erodes susceptible rocks (e.g Limestone)</li>

<li><em>Attrition</em> - Load collides together breaking of chunks of load and therefore eroding it.</li>

<li><em>Hydraulic Action</em> - The movement of water and air into cracks breaking apart rocks. Highly effective in high velocity rivers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='deposition'>Deposition</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Deposition occurs in areas with low velocity such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The mouth of the river.</li>

<li>An area with a relatively low gradient.</li>

<li>An area that experiences droughts.</li>

<li>An river flooding reduces velocity due to an increase friction.</li>

<li>The inside of a meander where friction increases due to a decrease in the volume of the water.</li>

<li>An increase in the load of the river causing the river to exceed its capacity.</li>

<li>A river crossing an area of permeable rock, which increases percolation rates, leading to a decreased volume of water in the channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='load_transport_processes'>Load Transport Processes</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Saltation</em> - Load is bounced along the bed of the river.</li>

<li><em>Solution</em> - Load is disolved into the river water.</li>

<li><em>Suspension</em> - Load is suspended in the river water.</li>

<li><em>Traction</em> - Load is rolled along the river bed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='key_terms'>Key Terms</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Capacity</em> - The total volume of load that can be carried in the channel at a specific location at a specific time.</li>

<li><em>Competence</em> - The largest transported particle that can be transported at a particular stream velocity.</li>
</ul>
