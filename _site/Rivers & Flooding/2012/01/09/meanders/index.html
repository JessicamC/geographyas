<h3 id='the_formation_of_meanders'>The Formation Of Meanders</h3>

<p>In low flow conditions, straight channels in soft alluvial material are seen to have alternating bars of sediment on their beds and the moving water is forced to weave around these bars. This creates alternating shallow sections (riffles) and deeper sections (pools).</p>

<h4 id='riffles__pools'>Riffles &amp; Pools</h4>

<p><img src='/Images/rivers/rifflesAndPools.png' alt='Riffles And Pools' /></p>

<p>The swing of the flow induced by these riffles and pools tends to direct the zone of maximum velocity and deepest water to one side of the channel, producing an area of intense erosion. The &#8220;concave&#8221; bank is eroded and undercut to produce a steep &#8220;river cliff&#8221;. This is accompanied by deposition on the convex bank forming a sand or gravel area called a &#8220;point bar&#8221;. Channel width remains fairly constant while the channel migrates laterally, becoming sinuous and developing the typical meander shape.</p>

<h3 id='cross_section_of_a_meander'>Cross Section Of A Meander</h3>

<p><img src='/Images/rivers/meanderCrossSection.png' alt='' /></p>

<ul>
<li>The water flow appears to be &#8220;helicoidal&#8221;. This means that as the water flows fastest on the outside bend, it is deflected around the bend by the river bank with a surface flow towards the bank and a return flow across the bed (a kind of corkscrew movement). The effect is to transport sediment eroded from the concave bank downstream to the convex bank where it is deposited in slack water to produce the point bar.</li>

<li>The greatest erosion occurs just downstream of the meander axis and so the meander migrates downstream. If the sinuosity becomes too great, then in flood, the river may be able to break the meander neck, straightening the channel and leaving a cut off loop (an oxbow lake).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='sinuosity_of_meanders'>Sinuosity Of Meanders</h3>

<p>Few rivers are exactly straight, the degree to which they vary from a straight line is known as their sinuosity. This can be measured by the ratio of the channel length to the straight line distance between the same two points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sinuosity = Channel Length / Straight Line Distance</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id='oxbow_lakes'>Oxbow Lakes</h3>

<p>Oxbow lakes are the result of an increasing sinuosity of a river. They are a feature of deposition and erosion. As a river&#8217;s sinuosity increases erosion on the outside bend of the meander increases whilst deposition on the inside bend increases too. As a result, the neck of the meander becomes narrower and, during periods of flood, the river cuts across the neck. Eventually, the neck is blocked off with deposition and the river assumes a new, straight, course across the neck. The old course becomes an oxbow lake. Over time, the lake dries up leaving a meander scar.</p>
